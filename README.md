# elevenlabsvoicegen
This project is designed to generate voice lines for video games using the ElevenLabs API. The program also employs OpenAI's ChatGPT to choose the best voices based on a given casting note, and generates multiple variants of each line with different voice settings. The user can specify certain voices to always include in the selection.
